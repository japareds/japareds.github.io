Air quality monitoring sensor networks focusing on air pollution
measure pollutants that are regulated by the authorities, such as CO,
NO2, NO, SO2, O3, and particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5). However,
there are other pollutants, such as black carbon (BC), which are
not regulated, have a major impact on health, and are rarely mea-
sured. One solution is to use proxies, which consist of creating a
mathematical model that infers the measurement of the pollutant
from indirect measurements of other pollutants. In this paper, we
propose a robust machine learning proxy (RMLP) framework for
estimating BC based on nonlinear machine learning methods, cali-
brating the low-cost sensors (LCSs), and adding robustness against
noise and data missing in the LCS. We show the impact of LCS data
aggregation, denoising and missing imputation on BC estimation,
and how the concentrations estimated by the BC proxy approximate
the values obtained by a reference instrument with an accurate BC
sensor.
