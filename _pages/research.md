My main research line is the use of machine learning techniques to analyze data captured with IoT devices. I am currently working in techniques necessary techniques to ensure an adequate level of quality in the data captured by low-cost sensors (LCS) networks, with emphasis on aspects related to the application of machine learning. 

The data sets can be further exploited by using a dispersion model that provides air quality forecasts of airborne pollutants and a data fusion methodology to combine sensor measurements with the computationally modeled long-term concentrations. This process corrects the modeled concentration field so that simulated values are adjusted in magnitude to match observations both in the local vicinity and globally across the domain, as well as providing insight into the spatial patterns far from the measuring site. 

Secondly, the use of dispersion models can be exploited to determine optimal sensor location. For a given pollution source, the dispersion model computes the concentration gradient at the sensor location which is weighted with the limit of detection of the sensor to obtain an observable area for the sensor. This procedure provides a hierarchical strategy for placing sensors so that the coverage area is maximized.
