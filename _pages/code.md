On my [github](https://github.com/japareds) you can explore some of my public projects I have been working on:

**The IRNet optimization method**: Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/japareds/IRNet).
This project presents an optimization method designed to determine the optimal locations for deploying monitoring stations to reconstruct a physical quantity.
Unlike classical machine learning models, this method incorporates statistical parameters, including the structure of the variance-covariance matrix.

**The rankMax algorithm for multi-class monitoring networks**: Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/japareds/rankMax-paper).
The rankMax algorithm is designed for reconstructing signals across multiple locations when information is limited to a small number of devices with varying capabilities. 
This project focuses on implementing a technology to enhance monitoring networks in such constrained scenarios.

**The Robust Black Carbon Proxy Model**: Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/japareds/RBCP).
In this project, I analyze the critical steps involved in building a robust machine learning model for Black carbon prediction. 
The model addresses challenges related to data quality, such as imputation, denoising, and aggregation, to ensure reliable predictions even when high-end Black carbon measurement devices are unavailable.
