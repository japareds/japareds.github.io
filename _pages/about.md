I am Juan Antonio Paredes Ahumada, astronomer by the [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://astro.uc.cl/) and PhD candidate in Computer Architecture at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya · [BarcelonaTech](https://doctorat.upc.edu/es) with a strong background in math, statistics, physics, and other quantitative fields. My main research focuses on applying innovative data analysis techniques to IoT platforms, medical imaging and computational physics. My academic journey combines a passion for understanding mathematical phenomena with the application of statistical techniques to develop innovative solutions to practical challenges, aiming to address issues that have a world-wide impact.

I am currently working on new optimization approaches designed to enhance signal reconstruction. These techniques incorporate specific mathematical constraints to improve the accuracy and reliability of the reconstructed signal. Feel free to explore my site to learn more about my research, publications, and projects.
